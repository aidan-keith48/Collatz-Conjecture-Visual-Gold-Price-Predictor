# Collatz Conjecture Visualization & Gold Price Prediction

This repository contains two unique projects that explore mathematical concepts and predictive modeling. Both projects aim to provide interactive and insightful tools for visualization and analysis.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Collatz Conjecture Visualization**

The **Collatz Conjecture** is an unsolved mathematical hypothesis suggesting that any positive integer will eventually reach 1 through a specific iterative process:

- **If the number is even**, divide it by 2.
- **If the number is odd**, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

This project offers:
- An interactive visualization of the Collatz sequences.
- The ability to input any positive integer and observe its sequence progression.
- A dynamic graph that allows exploration of patterns and behaviors in the conjecture.

This visualization provides an engaging way to study the conjecture's dynamics and complexity.

### 2. **Gold Price Prediction Model**

Accurate forecasting of gold prices is essential for investors, analysts, and policymakers. This project focuses on:
- Developing and testing prediction models using dummy gold price data.
- Exploring potential upper and lower bounds for gold price fluctuations.

Through these predictive techniques, the project aims to provide insights into gold price trends and their possible future movements.
